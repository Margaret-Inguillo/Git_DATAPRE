      "9:04 p.m. ET, June 25, 2020People should still be washing their hands and avoiding \"high-touch surfaces,\" expert warns CNNEmergency physician Leana Wen joined CNN's ongoing coronavirus town hall to answer questions from viewers on the disease, which has seen alarming spikes in the US this week.What does the CDC's new guidance mean?Today, the CDC updated its list of people who are most at risk of severe complications from coronavirus.The list includes people with severe kidney disease, lung disease, heart disease, and obesity. Obesity is a major one, since 40% of Americans fall under that category, said Wen.Pregnant women are now also on the list, and should consider themselves \"medically vulnerable,\" she said. Has the danger of infection via touching things declined?The most likely way you might get infected is through person-to-person contact, like being next to someone who is sneezing or talking. But there is still a risk of getting Covid-19 from surfaces, especially surfaces that are touched frequently by many people, said Wen — meaning it's still crucial to keep washing your hands and being careful what you touch.share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link\n",
      "8:58 p.m. ET, June 25, 2020Some of the biggest risk factors in catching Covid-19 are time and place, professor saysFrom CNN's Andrea KaneCNN contributor Erin Bromage CNNThe most important factors that affect your risk of getting infected with the coronavirus are the amount of time spent with someone and whether that time is spent inside or out, CNN contributor Erin Bromage told Wolf Blitzer Thursday on The Situation Room.Asked if a person should hold their breath when they’re walking by someone on the street who is not wearing a mask, Bromage, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, answered no. “I understand people think that that's a risk, but it's exposure to the virus, enough of the virus over enough of the time. When you're walking past somebody, holding your breath is really not going to reduce the risk for you very much at all. Nor does that person present a huge risk to you in the first place,” he said.As for the risk of catching the virus from a contaminated surface, it’s low but it’s “definitely a possibility.”“Our biggest risk is face-to-face conversations and being indoors with lots of people in an enclosed space,” said Bromage.“Time, definitely, is an issue with this. So, the longer you spend talking to somebody, the longer that you share a space with them, the higher the risk that you will get enough virus to become infected,” he added. Why wearing masks are important: “Masks stop emissions at the source. They stop them coming out of your mouth and moving into the air, into the environment. So, if we stop them where they start, they can never pose a risk to another person.” he said. He added that “even a poor fitting mask will do something, a better fitting mask does a lot more.”share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link\n",
